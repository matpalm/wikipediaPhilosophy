distance to philosophy

http://xkcd.com/903/

not such a big deal

questions
1) do all wikipedia articles link to philosophy?
2) what distribution do the distances take?

method:
1) get wikipedia dump from volume
2) parse to make a graph; term -> term
3) connected components; is it one? if not which one is philosophy in?
4) histogram of distances

part 1) get wikipedia dump from volume

go to snapshot snap-1781757e Wikipedia Extraction-WEX (Linux)
from it make a volume vol-? (in, say,  us-east-1c)
make an instance; ebs backed
attach volume to instance  i-71941410 (also in us-east-1c)

device /dev/sdk

copy from ebs to hdfs

 mkdir wiki; 
 sudo mount /dev/xvdk wiki
 hadoop fs -mkdir /full/articles
 hadoop fs -copyFromLocal wiki/rawd/freebase-wex-2009-01-12-articles.tsv /full/articles_one_file # 7 min
 hadoop fs -mkdir /full/redirects
 hadoop fs -copyFromLocal wiki/rawd/freebase-wex-2009-01-12-redirects.tsv /full/redirects

and for testing...
 hadoop fs -mkdir /sample/articles
 head -n100 wiki/rawd/freebase-wex-2009-01-12-articles.tsv > sample
 hadoop fs -copyFromLocal sample /sample/articles/freebase-wex-2009-01-12-articles.tsv

the interesting file is wiki/rawd/freebase-wex-2009-01-12-articles.tsv
which is 31G; 4,183,153 articles

http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/WEX/Documentation

it has 5 columns 
0 - id
1 - title
2 - date
3 - xml
4 - plain text

(maybe ignore this)
before going too far it'd be interesting to extract the actual list of titles..
 hadoop jar ~/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar -input /sample/articles/ -output /sample/titles -mapper '/usr/bin/cut -f2' -numReduceTasks 0
b(maybe ignore this)

first need to split into chunks for in/out of s3 (with gzipping)

hadoop jar ~/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar \
 -D mapred.min.split.size=419430400 \
 -D mapred.output.compress=true \
 -D mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec  \
 -input /full/articles_one_file/ -output /full/articles \
 -mapper /bin/cat -numReduceTasks 0 

reduces it to 79 files, 75mb each, 6gb total

after playing with the data and bit (and refining the algorithm) the basic heuristic is
 ignore until first <sentence>
 find first <target> that isn't article name (as often, the first one is)

of course it's not that simple, there are lots of extra special cases...

eg [File:BSicon ABZvlr.svg] [Category:AB Castellón players] or [Template:Sharpness Branch Line]

what the distinct values of these?

 hadoop jar ~/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar \
  -input /sample/articles/ -output /sample/article_types \
  -mapper '/usr/bin/python metaArticleTypes.py' -file metaArticleTypes.py \
  -reducer aggregate

of course, nothing is clean :D

$ hfs -cat /full/article_types/*|sort -k2 -t'    ' -nr|head -n20
normal file		 2684331
File   862604
Category	434783
Template	164138

File talk	903

so maybe ignore; File, Category, Template, Portal, Portal talk, File talk
curious now, what do these represent?

 ignore until first <sentence>
 find first <target> that 
  isn't article name (as often, the first one is)
  doesn't start with File:, Category:, Template:, Portal:, Portal talk:, File talk:

sometimes we just need to ignore the "article" too.
i think when the 'plain text' (col[4]) is <100 characters it's probably a meta article too...

in fact this seems to be a more general case;

so... 
 ignore if plain_text < 100 chars
 ignore until first sentence
  find first <target> that isn't article name

there is also another interesting file is freebase-wex-2009-01-12-redirects.tsv
which i suspect will be required since sometimes the second target will require redirect dereference

 hadoop jar ~/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar \
  -input /sample/articles/ -output /sample/edges \

agassi should be 'List of ATP number 1 ranked players'
(would be 'Kirk Kerkorian', his middle name, if we include synthetic links)

 remove all templates 
  <template.*?</template>
 remove all sythentic links 
  <link synthetic="true">.*?</link> 
 first target
  andre agassi link removed since synthetic

structure was...
articles
 article
  paragraph
   sentence
    first target  

though i think just targets after removing templates is enough...

comparing with ayn_rand
 it would be 'American values' if we include 'link synthetic="true"'
 but 'novelist' if we exclude 'link synthetic="true"'

sometimes there iis text before the 1st paragraph, eg disambiguation info...
so need to trim to first paragraph too!!

final is then..

 ignore "articles" that have a name starting with 'File:', 'Template:',etc
 ignore "articles" that have plain text less than 30 chars

 trim to first paragraph
 remove all templates 
  <template.*?</template>
 remove all sythentic links 
  <link synthetic="true">.*?</link>

Map input records      4,183,153 	
Map output records     2,624,994 	  

looking through the diff of the from_nodes to the to_nodes in the edges
looks like we need to convert the to_nodes to their redirects

 cut -f1 all.edges | sort > all.edges.from             # 2624994 lines
 cut -f2 all.edges | uniq | sort | uniq > all.edges.to # 497461 lines

the redirects file isn't huge (3.3e6 rows, 154mb) so i thought it'd feasbile to do this in memory.
eg see dereferenceToLinks.py
but it's a complete fail. splitting into 16 chunks & running in parallel on cc1.4xlarge and it's a fail. 
(running 10+hrs and each derefernce dict lookup taking roughly 2s for every 3 records (?! that's a 45hr runtime)
i obviously need to learn me some more python...

the main reason i did this since i thought they'd be multiple redirects but looking at ~200e3 samples it's not the
case, if there is a redirect it's directly done

which means this is just a join; do it in pig

-- pig -p SET=sample|full -f edges_dereferenced.pig
edges = load '$SET/edges' as (from_node: chararray, to_node: chararray);
redirects_with_id = load '$SET/redirects' as (id:long, from_node: chararray, to_node: chararray);
redirects = foreach redirects_with_id generate from_node, to_node;
joined = join edges by to_node left outer, redirects by from_node;
edges_dereferenced = foreach joined generate
	edges::from_node as from_node, 
	(redirects::to_node is null ? edges::to_node : redirects::to_node) as to_node;
store edges_dereferenced into '$SET/edges_dereferenced';

takes a minute. though of course this is not a fundamental pig vs python thing, it's an algorithm difference.
a simpler merge approach could have been done in python must faster too i'm sure

 cut -f1 all.edges_dereferenced | sort > all.edges_dereferenced.from             # 2624994 lines (sanity)
 cut -f2 all.edges_dereferenced | uniq | sort | uniq > all.edges_dereferenced.to # 455224 lines



now we can work on calculating the distance for each page from 'Philosophy', and this is simply a breadth first search

again, trying to be pragmatic, i wrote a version in python (distanceFromPhilosophy.py) but my god it's slow...
?seconds for ? lookups in a dict? what am i missing?

going to need beautiful soup

 tar zxf BeautifulSoup-3.2.0.tar.gz
 cd BeautifulSoup-3.2.0
 sudo python ./setup.py install

python
 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup 
 f = open('article.egs/1949_Coupe_de_France_Final.xml','r')
 soup = BeautifulStoneSoup(f.read())
 links = soup.findAll('link')

then for
 <link synthetic="true"><target>1949 Coupe de France Final</target><part>Coupe de France Final</part></link>

>>> links[0].target
<target>1949 Coupe de France Final</target>
>>> links[0].target.string
u'1949 Coupe de France Final'
>>> links[0].part
<part>Coupe de France Final</part>
>>> links[0].part.string
u'Coupe de France Final'

and for
 <link><target>Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir</target></link>

>>> links[2].target
<target>Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir</target>
>>> links[2].target.string
u'Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir'
>>> links[2].part == None
True

for template in soup.findAll('template'):
  template.extract()

also needed to another heuristic which was to only examine the first 10 links 
(otherwise the link 'fact' deep in the truth article matched a 'fact' plain text at the start of the article)
feels dangerous...

also noticed that 1949_Coupe_de_France_Final.eg -> soccer 
and not Soccer as it should, and there is no redirect, and the current life page is correctly Soccer
might need to handle this in graph redirecting, if not present, and lower case, try upper case
